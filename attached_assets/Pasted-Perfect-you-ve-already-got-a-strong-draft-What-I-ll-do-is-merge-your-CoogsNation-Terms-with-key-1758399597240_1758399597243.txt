Perfect — you’ve already got a strong draft. What I’ll do is **merge your CoogsNation Terms with key protective elements from the SIDEARM Sports ToS** (especially around: user submissions, disclaimers, dispute resolution, and third-party links) so you’re maximally covered while staying tailored to your independent site.

Here’s the **combined Terms of Use draft for CoogsNation.com**:
